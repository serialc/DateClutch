        <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
        <p>
        DateClutch is committed to protecting the privacy of those visiting the website and use the services. This Privacy Policy describes (1) the types of information DateClutch collects about you (sometimes called “personal information”) when you access or use our website, applications, products, services, and tools (collectively, the “Services”); (2) how DateClutch uses your information; and (3) your choices regarding how we use or share that information.
        </p>

        <p>
        We want to try to make this Privacy Policy as accessible and useful to our visitors as possible. With that in mind, we’ve provided a high-level overview below to give you a general sense of what data we collect and how we use it. If you would like more details, however, we encourage you to keep reading past the overview. And if you have questions about our policies, you can contact DateClutch's creators on github.

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
        In general, DateClutch only collects information you explicitly submit. This typically means your name, to 'clutch'/reserve a date/time for a poll. If you provide an email address to receive a notification, the email is not stored.
        If you create an DateClutch account, you will need to provide contact information, such as your email, and your name, to use the services. Note that your email address will be shared with those that respond to the polls you create.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the following sections, 'we' refers to DateClutch.

        </p>

        <h3>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h3>

        even better user experience, to safeguard our Services, to communicate with you, to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our services, to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services, and to personalize your experience.

Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Information</h3>

        <p>
        Certain local laws establish rights for consumers who are subject to their protections. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation provides for the following rights for individuals whose data is collected in the EU:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Right to request access to your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to request correction or deletion of your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to object to our use and processing of your personal data</li>
            <li>Right to request that we limit our use and processing of your personal data and</li>
            <li>Right to request portability of your personal data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        While these rights are not absolute – e.g., we do not have to delete your data if we need the data for compliance with a legal obligation – and they are not legally required in every jurisdiction in which we collect data, DateClutch wants to make it easy and straightforward for all our users to enjoy these rights, we provide you the ability to exercise certain controls regarding our collection, use, and sharing of your information. Consistent with that approach, we provide you with several choices when it comes to information about you:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Set Your Browser to Reject Cookies</b>: As mentioned above, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies before using DateClutch’s services, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</li>
            <li><b>Close Your Account</b>: If you created a profile or account with us, you can contact the person that created your account to request that we close a your account.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        If you have any questions or otherwise would like to contact us about one of these rights, you can contact us on github to ask a question or request to exercise one of your rights.
        We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law.
        We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request – this is solely to protect you, and we will not use any of the information you provide us to confirm your identity for anything other than confirming your identity.
        In some functions of the Services you may exercise these controls via your account settings in addition to contacting us.
        However, not all of our Services allow you to access, correct, or delete your personal data within your account settings.
        If applicable, you can make a complaint to the government supervisory authority of your jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h3>Third-Party Websites and Services</h3>

        <p>
        Some DateClutch polls may link to external resources that are not owned or controlled by us, such as GitHub, YouTube, or social media platforms. DateClutch has no control, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
        If you choose to use any third-party websites or services, the collection, use, and disclosure of your information on those websites will be subject to the privacy policies of these websites and services.
        </p>
